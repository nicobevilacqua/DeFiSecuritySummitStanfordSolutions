## Important note

This set of challenges aren't set for competitive purposes. Their main objective is to showcase scenarios involving DeFi, `Solidity` concepts and common vulnerabilities.

Focus on **learning** and having **fun**! 😊

------------------------------

# **Challenges** 🎮

## **Challenge 0: VitaToken seems safe, right?**

Let's begin with a simple warm up.
Our beloved Vitalik is the proud owner of **100 $VTLK**, which is a token that follows the ERC20 token standard. Or at least that is what it seems... 😉😉😉

📌 Upon deployment, the `VToken` contract mints **100 $VTLK** to Vitalik's address.

Is there a way for you to **steal** those tokens from him? 😈😈😈

-----------
**The contracts that you will hack are**:

-  **[VToken](https://github.com/eugenioclrc/DeFi-Security-Summit-Stanford/blob/master/challenges_sources/Challenge0.VToken.sol)**

-----------
## **Challenge 1: What a nice Lender Pool!**

Secureum has raised a lot of Ether and decided to buy a bunch of 
`InSecureumToken`s (**$ISEC**) in order to make them available to the community
via flash loans. This is made possible by means of the `InSecureumLenderPool` contract.

📌 Upon deployment, the `InSecureumToken` contract mints an initial supply of 10 **$ISEC** to the contract deployer.

📌 The `InSecureumLenderPool` contract operates with **$ISEC**.

📌 The contract deployer transfers all of their **$ISEC** to the `InSecureumLenderPool` contract.

📌 The idea is that anyone can deposit **$ISEC**s to enlarge the pool's resources.

Will you be able to **steal** the **$ISEC**s from the `InSecureumLenderPool`? 😈😈😈

**The contracts that you will hack are**:

- **[InSecureumLenderPool](https://github.com/eugenioclrc/DeFi-Security-Summit-Stanford/blob/master/challenges_sources/Challenge1.lenderpool.sol)**

**Which have interactions with the following contracts:**

- **[InSecureumToken](https://github.com/eugenioclrc/DeFi-Security-Summit-Stanford/blob/master/challenges_sources/tokens/tokenInsecureum.sol)**

-----------

## **Challenge 2: it's always sunny in decentralized exchanges**

I bet you are familiar with **decentralized exchanges**: a magical place where one can exchange different tokens.\
`InsecureDexLP` is exactly that: a <s>very insecure</s> Uniswap-kind-of decentralized exchange.\
Recently, the **$ISEC** token got listed in this dex and can be traded against a *not-so-popular* token called **$SET**.

📌 Upon deployment, the `InSecureumToken` and `SimpleERC223Token` contracts mint an initial supply of tokens 10 **$ISEC** and 10 **$SET** to the contract deployer.

📌 The `InsecureDexLP` operates with **$ISEC** and **$SET**.

📌 The dex has an initial liquidity of 9 **$ISEC** and 9 **$SET**, provided by the contract deployer. This quantity can be increased by anyone through token deposits.

📌 Adding liquidity to the dex rewards liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens), which can be redeemed in any moment for the original funds.

📌 In the `foundry` implementation, the deployer graciously airdrops the challenger (*you!*) 1 **$ISEC** and 1 **$SET**. In the `TenderlySandbox` implementation, the challenger must call the exclusive `claimAirdrop()` functions of each of the token contracts, obtaining this way 1 **$ISEC** and 1 **$SET**.

Will you be able to **drain** most of `InsecureDexLP`'s **$ISEC**/**$SET** liquidity? 😈😈😈

## **Challenge 3: borrow, hide and seek**

Finally, as a conclusion to this <s>not-so-secure</s> ecosystem, the Secureum team built the `BorrowSystemInsecureOracle` lending platform where one can borrow and loan **$ISEC** and `BoringToken` (**$BOR**). Both tokens can be borrowed by either providing themselves or the other token as collateral.

📌 Upon deployment, the `InSecureumToken` and `BoringToken` contracts mint an initial supply of 30000 **$ISEC** and 20000 **$BOR** to the contract deployer.

📌 `BorrowSystemInsecureOracle` uses the `InsecureDexLP` to compute the **$ISEC**/**$BOR** price.

📌 The deployer adds an initial liquidity of 100 **$ISEC** and 100 **$BOR** to the `InsecureDexLP`.

📌 Similarly, `InSecureumLenderPool` contract is funded with 10000 **$ISEC** by the deployer.

📌 The `BorrowSystemInsecureOracle` contract has an initial amount of 10000 **$ISEC** and 10000 **$BOR** provided by the deployer.

📌 Users can add collateral and take loans from `BorrowSystemInsecureOracle`.

📌 Users may also get liquidated.



Will you be able to **drain** all the **$ISEC** from `BorrowSystemInsecureOracle`? 😈😈😈
